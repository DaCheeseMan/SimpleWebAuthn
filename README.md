## Overview

This project features two complimentary libraries to help reduce the amount of work needed to
incorporate WebAuthn into a website. The following packages are maintained here:

- [@simplewebauthn/server](https://github.com/MasterKale/SimpleWebAuthn/tree/master/packages/server)
- [@simplewebauthn/browser](https://github.com/MasterKale/SimpleWebAuthn/tree/master/packages/browser)

An additional package is also included that contains shared TypeScript definitions:

- [@simplewebauthn/types](https://github.com/MasterKale/SimpleWebAuthn/tree/master/packages/types/)

## Installation

SimpleWebAuthn can be installed from **[NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40simplewebauthn)** and
**[JSR](https://jsr.io/@simplewebauthn)** in **Node LTS 20.x and higher**, **Deno v1.43 and higher**
projects, and other compatible runtimes (Cloudflare Workers, Bun, etc...)

See the packages' READMEs for more specific installation information.

## Documentation

## Example

For a practical guide to implementing these libraries, take a look at the
[example project](https://github.com/MasterKale/SimpleWebAuthn/tree/master/example). It includes a
single-file Express server and a few HTML files that, combined with the packages in this repo, are
close to all it takes to get up and running with WebAuthn.

## Development

Install the following before proceeding:

- **Deno v2.0.x**

After pulling down the code, set up dependencies:

```sh
$> deno install
```

To run unit tests for all workspace packages, use the `test` series of scripts:

```sh
# Run an individual package's tests
$> cd packages/browser/ && deno task test
$> cd packages/server/ && deno task test
```

Tests can be run in watch mode with the `test:watch` series of scripts:

```sh
$> cd packages/browser/ && deno task test:watch
$> cd packages/server/ && deno task test:watch
```
